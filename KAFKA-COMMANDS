How to create a Topic?

How to start producer?

Producer needs broker and topic to write the data.

kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic

after executing this command you can start write to topic.

How to acknowledge to all?

kafka-cons-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --producer-property acks=all

How to crate topic dynamically while writing from producer?

kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic new_topic

Note:
beacause the election is not happend 

1) since you are creating topic dynamically there are no leaders available for it so you will get a warning message.

leader election will happen when you start sending the message...

2) producer is able to recover from errors.. once you see the above error and still you can wrtie to the newly created topic  

3)  if you list of topics you will see new topic.

 -> By default the dynamically crated topic will be having 1 partition 
 -> if you want to change the default partition open “nano config/server.properties”
->  under “LOG BASICS” change the number of partitions to as many you want.
-> and finally restart the kafka server to reflect the changes.

Consumers:[Read message from producer when producer is active and sending]

1) To consume a message from producer:

“first_topic” is the topic name where producer is writing to

kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic


1) Consumers:[Read All message from producer]

kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic –from-beginning


2) Consumer Groups:

Creating a consumer group:

kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --group my-first-application
